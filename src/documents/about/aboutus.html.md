The Crystal Palace festival has been running successfully for the last six years. In 2011, it expanded to
Westow Park, with a live music stage, food and craft stalls, arts workshops, sports and kids' activities,
adding to the many events around the Triangle.

**Approximately, 5000 people attended in 2012** and the event was a roaring success with many people from neighbouring
areas joining locals for a joyous day of fun and festivities. The festival once again proved what a great place
Crystal Palace is to live and visit and after community consultation, the organisers are looking forward to a festival
that fulfils the priorities for the area in 2013.

# FAQs

**Q. How is the festival staffed and organised?**<br/>
**A.** The festival is being run entirely voluntarily – the organisers are all donating their time and skills
for free. Local musicians, artists, performers and arts workshop leaders are also donating their time and talents
to make this a great festival for their community.

**Q. How is the event funded?**<br/>
**A.** Local businesses sponsored the festival and bought advertising in the What’s On Guide and the website. Food
and crafts stalls also brought in income and various fundraising activities took place, including a raffle on the
day of the festival.

**Q. How were these funds used?**<br/>
**A.** An extensive campaign of posters, flyers and What’s On Guides were funded to draw the audience of 5,000 people
to the festival. A live music stage and PA, stalls and tents were hired. Funds also paid for insurance, toilets, first aid and park hire.

**Q. How can I get involved?**<br/>
**A.** Please email <volunteer@crystalpalacefestival.org> or [read our volunteering page][1].

**Q. How can I trade at the festival?**<br/>
**A.** We are afraid that the stalls have now sold out. Please check back early in 2014 for opportunities at next year’s festival.

**Q. What are the plans for the future of the festival?**<br/>
**A.** An open meeting was held in December 2012 to ask the community what the aims, objectives and priorities
should be for the festival. Feedback on past festivals and ideas for the future were also collected. Please [download
the report][2] from this meeting (pdf) and let us know your thoughts.

Long-term funding for the festival must be secured to ensure its future and the present organisers are busy recruiting
fundraisers to take the festival from strength to strength in 2013 and into the coming decade. If you can help
