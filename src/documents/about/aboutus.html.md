**Approximately 5000 people attended in 2012**. The event was a roaring success, with many people from neighbouring areas joining locals for a joyous day of fun and festivities. The festival once again proved what a great place Crystal Palace is to live and visit, and after community consultation the organisers are looking forward to a festival that fulfils the priorities for the area in 2013.

# FAQs

**Q. How is the festival staffed and organised?**<br/>

for free. Local musicians, artists, performers and arts workshop leaders are also donating their time and talents
to make this a great festival for their community.

**Q. How is the event funded?**<br/>
**A.** Local businesses sponsored the festival and bought advertising in the What’s On Guide and website. Food
and crafts stalls also brought in income and various fundraising activities took place, including a raffle on the
day of the festival.

**Q. How were these funds used?**<br/>
**A.** An extensive campaign of posters, flyers and What’s On Guides were funded to draw the audience of 5,000 people
to the festival. A live music stage and PA, stalls and tents were hired. Funds also paid for insurance, toilets, first aid and park hire.
