The event went from strength to strength in June 2013, with a fantastic park event on Saturday, the massive success of the Triangle Day on Sunday and more events across the area than every before.

Here are some facts and figures about this year’s festival:

- Approximately 6,000 visitors came to Westow Park and the Triangle on Saturday 29 June
- It’s difficult to say how many visitors there was on Sunday 30 June and at the other events across the 4 day festival but all were well attended
- Sunday was busy and buzzy with two new events from the festival committee - the vintage hub and the fine art and craft market
- For the first time we had a performing arts tent, a holistic tent and a kids’festival within the park festival which were all very popular parts of the event
- 60 events were held across the Upper Norwood area outside of the Saturday park event, a new record for traders and venues getting involved in the festival
- 155 performers and artistes took part in the festival
- The festival committee raised approximately £30k in 2013 from sponsors, advertisers, Big Lottery funding, Lambeth Council, Croydon Council, stalls, t-shirt sales donations, event listings and bar income
- The festival is a not-for-profit event and all income raised goes into funding it. Download the [2011 accounts][3] and [2012 accounts][4].
- Approximately 150 volunteers organised the festival and ran it over the 4 days of the event
- All volunteers worked for free and continue to contribute their skills to make sure the festival goes ahead in 2014.
