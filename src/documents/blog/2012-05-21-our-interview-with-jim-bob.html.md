**Are there any terrifying music teachers we have to thank for your pop career? How did you get your start in music?**

He wasn’t terrifying, but my music teacher Mr Daley played guitar at my first ever live performance when I was about fifteen. There were three of us in and the band. And Mr Daley. He held it all together as he was the only one who could actually play. My daughter went to the same school and years later I went back as a parent and Mr Daley was still there. I was too timid to talk to him. There was also a guitar teacher but I gave up after two lessons because I wanted to play Summertime Blues, not Streets of London.

**Did you always think you’d end up playing in bands? What was the moment with your first band, Jamie Wednesday, when you knew music was what you wanted to do?**

I knew at school, years before. Also, when I saw the film Stardust with David Essex and wanted to be him.

**Give us an idea of what it was like in the London pop scene in the nineties. What was it like following the Brit Pop boom?**

My success with Carter came before the Brit Pop years. It’s the first few years of the nineties that have been written out of musical history. Judging by the musical output of BBC4. The scene I was a part of was spread across the country and I remember touring and playing outside London more fondly in a way.

**Having said that, Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine had plenty of success and still sells out major venues like Brixton Academy! You obviously attracted a dedicated audience somewhere in those 14 top 40 singles and the number one album – are you finding that it’s mostly original fans or have you picked up new followers along the way?**

There are definitely some new people. They may be kids of fans I suppose but I think people can discover music from the past and find it exciting, they don’t have to have been there at the time it was created. The band do tend to be the oldest people in the building.

**Your bio says that Carter USM was known for ‘a use of puns’. Did that flair for wordplay inspire you to write your two novels?**

I think so. I’ve always liked words. With the novels I’ve had a lot of people talking about whether songwriting musicians can write books. But to me they seem the likeliest people to do so.

**It seems like you’ve dabbled in writing songs for the stage as well as writing for the screen – did you fall into writing from songwriting or was it something you always thought you might end up doing?**

I started writing songs when I was a teenager and most of the other more varied things I’ve written for, I’ve stumbled into by chance. I wrote two songs for a pantomime at the Barbican for example.

**What can people expect from your novels?**

The big thing people seem to pick up on is that they’re funny and dark. Black comedy. And there are illustrations, which keep being referred to as crude, which I can’t really argue with.

**Have you always lived south of the river? As someone who’s only recently arrived here (moved to the area about 2 months ago!) I am overwhelmed by the amount of creativity at my doorstep. What do you think that says about South London? What are your favourite things about Crystal Palace?**

I have. I was born in Streatham and have never lived further than a few miles away. I’ve been in Crystal Palace for years. It’s changed massively. I think for the better. I’ve always said I don’t really like South London and want to move away but then get incredibly defensive if people (usually from North London) slag it off. I like Crystal Palace at the weekend when it becomes a bit like a busy village.
