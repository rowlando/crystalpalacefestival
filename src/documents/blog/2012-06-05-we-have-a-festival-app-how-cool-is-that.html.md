After visiting Glastonbury last year for the umpteenth time, I thought how brilliant their app was and how cool would it be if we had a Crystal Palace Overground Festival app? And lo it came to pass when I met with Ben from Tens and Units who kindly volunteered to help the festival this year. After much work from Ben and his partner James, we tested it out and moved all the pins around, updated the database a few times (tedious work but well worth it) and now it’s launched! All you have to do is go to iTunes and type Crystal Palace Overground Festival in the search and then you can download it for free!

Apologies to all other smartphone users but we unfortunately didn’t have the time or resources to develop the app for other platforms. Maybe next year.

The map has all the festival venues, and the sponsors and advertisers who supported the festival on it. You can also view all of the artists and venues in more detail on the other pages. We are so excited about the app and thank Ben and James for all their hard work which they did for free! How cool is that? We are constantly amazed at how much the people of Crystal Palace do for the love of this fantastic place and this is just another great example of that dedication. Go Crystal Palace!
