With less than a week to go til the festival, we’re getting pretty excited here at Overground Festival HQ. Stay tuned to the blog for last minute news and updates. But first, get to know a few of the bands taking to the stage next Saturday! First to be interviewed is John Blood from [John Blood and the Highlys][1].

**What’s the story behind ‘The Highlys’? How did that name come about?**

I (John) was looking to start a band after years of doing solo open mic stuff. We’ve known each other for about two years, some of us for more. We’re a group of friends who love and enjoy making and playing music together. We had been looking for a name for some time. ‘The Highlys’ was one of many names floating around, we chose it because it sounded cool at first, but we’ve grown into it. It sums up how lucky we feel about being alive, having love in our lives and making music!

**With 8 members, your influences must be pretty varied! Who are your musical inspirations?**  
We come from all over, and not just all over the UK! With members from the Caribbean, France, UK and West Africa there are a lot of influences, but I would say as a group reggae, blues, calypso, soukous and afrobeat are what we are influenced most by when making music. But even then there are elements of other genres. It’s a universal thing.

**Tell us a secret you know about South London.**  
If I told it wouldn’t be secret ;-)

**Are most of you based in Crystal Palace? What do you like most about the area?**  
We’re actually based north of the river. I used to come here a lot. I had a few friends living in the area and I love how green it is, more or less as soon as you come out of the station. A couple years back I went to the Aviva Grand Prix at the Sports Centre with my Mum and cuz. We loved it, great advert for the area.

**What we can expect from your set at the Festival?**  
We're gonna bring the sunshine :-)

Look out for John Blood and the Highlys playing on Saturday 16th June in Westow Park.
