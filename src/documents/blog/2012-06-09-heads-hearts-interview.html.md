Another of our awesome bands, [Heads Hearts][1], took some time to answer a few quick questions about their music and how they're gearing up for the festival. Get to know Amber Taylor-Groves (ATG), Lynne Porterfield (LKP) and Abby Tythe (ABS)  before they rock out for us next weekend.

**I love the description of Heads Hearts on your website! That kind of attitude shines through in your music. What/who are your musical inspirations?**

ATG: Anyone that is good, I know that sounds cliché but it's true. I love pretty much every type of music, but these are just a few: Florence and the Machine, Daft Punk, Mike Snow, Basement Jaxx, Tina Turner, Prince, Donna Summer.

LKP: I like a whole lotta styles of music from Black Sabbath to Emmylou Harris to Four Tet to The Jackson 5. In a weird way I think we are a blend of all of the above.

ABS: I'm pretty much inspired by anybody that can whack a drum. Although I'm always in awe of Matt Helders (arctic monkeys drummer). That dude knows his stuff!

**How did the band get together? Are you all from around South London?**

ATG: HH was formed about 3 years ago by me and a very good friend of mine. We spent 8 months solid writing and recording a lot of material together and we took it on the road and receive a great response. A year or so on and I decided that I wanted more musicians on stage and my partner in crime had to leave the stage due to family commitments. I already knew LKP & Abs through friends and they had been to quite a few gigs, so I decided to see if they fancied joining me to make some noise. There was born the new Heads Hearts.
I am the only one that's from South London but LKP does live around the corner from me now which is very cool.

LKP: Amber and I now live down the street from each other but I'm from East London and originally from San Francisco so I'm the token Yank. Abs is rockin' the Essex thang.

ABS: We're from all over the place but I used to go and watch Heads Hearts before Lynne or I were part of it. I met Amber through a friend and she asked me if I fancied hitting stuff down the studio with her and Lynne. I jumped at the chance, I was pretty nervous but managed to get involved and the rest is history.

**What have been some musical highlights for the band so far?**

ATG: Getting to hang out with these girls and play to packed out rooms of people dancing around like lunatics, you've got to be happy with that. But the same thing is at the top of the list for all of us on this one, I'll let LKP explain.

LKP: A festival we played last year was a real moment. Mainly because we were subjected to torrential rain all weekend but when we hit the stage at sunset the sun came out and backlit the uber enthused crowd. It was nice to see so many smiling faces out there… it was probably that they were drunk but hopefully the sun and the music added a little something. Apart from that, every HH gig is a highlight. It's so much fun playing with these two ladies. They are ridiculous.com!

ABS: There have been loads! We've been together a year now and we've come on leaps and bounds. Playing a festival at sunset was quality. There was even a tear in my eye. Oh and making the video to “in my blood” was a lot of fun.

**How would you describe Crystal Palace in five words or less?**

AT-G: We all answered these questions separately and the girls sent me their answers. This is genuinely what the pair of them sent back to me unbeknown to each other ‘Crystaly & palacey'. So I guess that has to be our answer.

**What can festival-goers expect from a Heads Hearts set?**

AT-G: A proper high energy show. Because we all love what we do I think that really shines through on stage. Our main aim is to make people enjoy themselves, it doesn't take too much ‘making'.

LKP: We'll get your blood pumping, your heart thumping and your ass jumping. (Plus we won't have any rhymes that terrible in any of our songs!)

ABS: Pure entertainment, Amazing energy, a good mixture of electro sounds and live instruments. Oh and a bouncy little lady belting out some blinders on the stage. That's what I reckon but come see for yourself :-)
