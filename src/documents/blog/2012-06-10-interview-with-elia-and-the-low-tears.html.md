The interviews keep coming with Elia and the Low Tears! Get to know a bit about them before you check out their set next weekend…

**What’s the story behind the name The Low Tears?**  
Low Tears means big, fundamental human emotions. Like what you feel when you eat ice cream.

**Musical inspirations?**  
We love great pop songwriting, as well as funk and soul and rock. All the sounds that are mixed up in our music. We would like to think of ourselves as the resulting love child of a night of passion between Prince and Joni Mitchell and Aretha Franklin and Talk Talk.

**Tell us a secret you know about South London.**  
It’s the best place for birthday morning pancakes.

**What are you looking forward to about the Festival this year?**  
We’re expecting a great atmosphere. There seems to be lots of fun things happening and it looks like it will be relaxed and unpretentious. Plus obviously we’re looking forward to ramping people up with our noise.

**Your song Perfect Circles has quite a tongue in cheek music video. Is that the kind of thing we can expect from your set at the festival this year?**  
We won’t have a live feed on video screens of mad fans dancing to us in real time on the internet, on this occasion. The show is pretty full on. High voltage and funky with hooks. We like to make sure tailfeathers get shook.
