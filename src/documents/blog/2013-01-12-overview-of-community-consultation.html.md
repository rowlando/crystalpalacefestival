The consultation evening brought together a wide range of local people who looked to review previous festivals, list all the stakeholders of the festival and identify the aims, objectives and priorities for the festival going forwards.

A summary of each point and common threads can be found below and you can <a href="/files/festival-community-meeting-report-2012-12.pdf" title="Festival Community Meeting Report December 2012 (PDF 32KB)">download the Community Report</a>.

## Review of previous festivals

There were lots of positive comments! Many specific points were raised that need to be picked up by this year's team, when in place.

Other common threads were to:

- Increase diversity, e.g. more for teenagers, more diversity of music, seating for older people.</li>
- Review the date: some strong calls to stay in June, several calls to move it later again.</li>
- Improve specific aspects: from communication with groups to marketing to more toilets!</li>
- Review timings.</li>
- Call to strengthen the festival outside the park and re-address the balance between park and triangle.</li>

## Stakeholders

The stakeholders of the Crystal Palace Festival range from the community as a whole, to all the local community groups, businesses and organisations with a link to Crystal Palace, including transport organisations; plus local government, schools and other statutory bodies and funding bodies. The full list should serve to help the new organising committee. Stakeholders make up the list of not only who the festival is for, but who can help make it a sustainable success.

## Aims and objectives

The consultation asked people to write down what they felt should be the aims and objectives for the festival in 2013. There was a fair amount of overlap with the comments written down when we asked everyone for their priorities for the event.  However, in this section, key points that found common ground were:

- bringing the whole community together
- having fun
- the promotion of Crystal Palace, its people and all it has to offer.

Please read the full report for some other great points.

## Priorities

There was much crossover with the section on Aims and Objectives, but in this section, the words 'showcasing', 'promoting' and 'supporting' Crystal Palace and what it has to offer â€“ both the place and the people - were often mentioned as was the importance of bringing the community together and appealing to the widest possible range of people.  Beyond the clear common ground, there was a range of brilliant points made for the new organising committee to try to live up to!

## Ideas

The Ideas section of the consultation was set aside from the main event with the point made that many ideas will not make it to become a reality without someone to take it forward. Hopefully those who attended and others who can help organise the event can come forward to take roles and help make these ideas happen!  Please come forward now if you can volunteer to join the organising team and make the festival in 2013 simply brilliant!
