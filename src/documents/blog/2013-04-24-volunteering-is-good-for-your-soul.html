<p>Recent research has shown that that giving time and energy to help others not only makes people feel good, but it has a direct and positive effect on physical wellbeing.  So why not do some good for yourself and your community and apply to volunteer this year?</p>

<p>Seasoned volunteer Cathy Henchion shared with us some of the opportunities for participation in this year's Crystal Palace Overground Festival.  She is recruiting volunteers from the community and has opportunities for people of all ages: from stewarding around the main outdoor stage in Westow Park on Saturday 29 June, to
supervising the Kids' Zone and meeting and greeting visitors.</p>

<p>"We're looking for passionate, fun-loving volunteers, aged 18 and over to
ensure this year's community arts festival is bigger and better then ever
before."</p>

<p>Cathy started working with the Festival three years ago. "There are so many reasons to get involved," says Cathy.  "It's great to be a part of something, to make things happen.  You get to make new friends and it's also good fun."</p>

<p>Volunteers come from every age group from 18&ndash;70 years old.  "It's a chance to encourage collaboration between the generations.  The combination of energy and enthusiasm combined with the opportunity to learn and participate in a group venture makes it a truly social experience."</p>

<p>For many, the success of London 2012 was due in part to the army of volunteers who gave up their time and energy to ensure that the Olympics were such a great success.  There may have been physical benefits for the volunteers too.  Being big-hearted can help to reduce cholesterol levels and body mass index, according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  Canadian researchers found that volunteering work not only reduced risk factors like cholesterol and body fat, it also reduced associated factors like stress by improving self esteem, mental health and mood.</p>

<p>The festival kicks off with a wide range of fringe events at venues around
Crystal Palace on June 27 and 28.  "We're particularly keen for people to come forwards and volunteer as Stewards at Westow Park on Saturday 29 June and the Upper Norwood Triangle on Sunday 30.  You could volunteer to be a Steward for as few as 4 hours," says Cathy. "You're there to help if needed but you will still be able to enjoy the Festival even 'on duty'"</p>

<p>If you can spare a few hours on one of the festival days, then please do <a href="/volunteer/">let us know via the volunteer form</a>.</p>
