Noreen Meehan, chair and programme director for the festival, gives us an update about
all the hard work going on organising 2013's festival:

> "It's all going really well but as
    usual there's a mad dash to get everything confirmed in time to do a great marketing campaign.
    I am chasing around the Triangle to get all of the traders' and venues' events into the
    printed guide and the park programming is just about finished. We should have a final
    programme up on the new website around 16 May, fingers crossed! There are lots of new
    initiatives this year as we have had a wonderful team of volunteers come on board – more
    than ever before – which means we can do more! Our local businesses have also come up
    trumps sponsoring and advertising with the festival and we have some grant money too so it's all really good."

> "New things in Westow Park on Saturday 29 June include a performing arts tent,
    a dedicated kids' zone with more activities than ever before and even more bars which is of
    course very important! Not forgetting the new [farmers' market][1]
    from our great Transition Town that will be happening in Haynes Lane on that Saturday. I have personally been working with
    lots of fab people around the Triangle, our venues and traders, to get our new Triangle day on
    Sunday 30 June off the ground and I am very excited about all the activities we are able to
    put on with their help and support! Look out for more on this day but we can reveal that
    there will be a vintage event in Church Road, a fine art and craft fair in Haynes Lane, a
    fitness fun event in Victory Place, Grooveschool are doing DJ skills workshops for young people
    and that doesn't even include all the traders' events and stalls plus loads of excellent live
    music and food from the pubs and venues around the area. So I think it might be best if you
    all took the Monday off work – I know I will be! Looking forward to seeing you all there!"
