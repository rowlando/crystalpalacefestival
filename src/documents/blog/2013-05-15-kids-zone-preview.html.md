Rachel D'Cruze and Veryan Wilkie-Jones share their programme for this year's Kids Zone at Westow Park - “Keep 
them busy, keep them interested and mostly keep them entertained!” We think we've managed to get something for 
everyone and so we hope you'll love what we've put together. Having a dedicated Kids' Zone this year certainly 
has made life easier, and we feel we've created a mini kids' festival full of delights. With a dedicated Sporty 
Area including hulahooping, tootball, space hoppers and Zumba throughout the day, to our Performance Tent with 
Rockmount Primary Children's Choir to open, followed by drama, music, dance performances and a fantastic piece 
of theatre turning your kids into detectives with Detect Egg from [Simply Smiley Productions][11] – what's not to like?!

Ah but that's not all...we have also brought our story telling tent to life with local authors and illustrators, [Alex
Milway][7], [Gary Northfield][8], [Tim][10] and [Marion][9] Sharville but also including a fab programme from Upper Norwood Library.

More you cry! Okay so for the artist in you, visit our Arts Tent! We have a two hour mosaic workshop from [Art4Space][3],
plus [Blue Sparrow Art][4] and Artstastic. Still not enough??? Well, what would an event be without a bouncy castle?
Yep oh and we've managed to get two – one for the little 'uns and one for older kids. Face painting, 
you ask? Yes, all courtesy of [Glitterbees][5] and [Doxa][6], all rounded off with a kids' disco in the main tent
courtesy of the Wilky Bar Kid & Finlay (aged 6).

Lastly but not leastly, huge THANKS go to our Kids' Zone sponsors local Crystal Palace shop [Smash
Bang Wallop][1] &ndash; we couldn't have done it without you. Detect Egg from Simply Smiley Productions has
been individually sponsored by local businesses, [Sell It Mama!][2] & [Physiotherapy Solutions][12].
