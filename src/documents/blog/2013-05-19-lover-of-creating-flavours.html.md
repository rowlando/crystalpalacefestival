Inspired by the huge success of A Taste of SE19, the food tasting tent at last year’s Crystal Palace Overground
Festival, Anita-Clare Field, founder of [Lover of Creating Flavours][1],
leapt at the opportunity to come on board as this year’s tent sponsor, one of the many specialist areas in
Westow Park on Saturday June 29.

Food is Anita’s passion whether it’s writing about it for her phenomenally successful food blog, or experimenting
in the kitchen with family and friends, food is at the heart of her life.

“I’m passionate about encouraging people to steer clear of the confines of a recipe by adding ingredients to
their own personal taste, to create a unique gastronomic delight to tantalise the tastes buds,” says Anita.

“I’ve lived in Crystal Palace for the last 25 years and I think the festival’s a wonderful thing, it has the
local community at its heart, from supporting local businesses, to creating an event the whole family can enjoy.”

I’m really excited to be involved this year, and very much look forward to sharing our exciting and diverse
programme with you all.”

To whet your appetite, our food demonstrations and tastings will include:

- **Beer & Cheese** delights from Manish Utton-Mishra of [Good Taste Food and Drink][2]
- Tour the [Crystal Palace Transition Town's][3] **Edible Garden** with Rachel de Thample, before turning your handpicked crop into delicious dishes
- **Learn how to make the Brazilian national dish**, feijoada, with Mariana Camarotte of the [Braziliana café][4]
- **Afternoon tea gets a makeover** with Jayne Totty of [Supernourished][5]
- **Mauritian street food** comes to life thanks to Selina Periampillai, creator of [Yummy Choo][6], Mauritian cuisine

Wind down with our **cocktail hour demo**, before continuing the evening by visiting one of the many award-winning
bars and restaurants around the Crystal Palace triangle.

We look forward to seeing you all very soon!
