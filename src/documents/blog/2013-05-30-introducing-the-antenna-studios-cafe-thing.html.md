Rather symbiotically, the Crystal Palace Overground Festival is happening at approximately one year since
[Antenna Studios][1] opened its [Café Thing][2]. It's been a
wonderfully abundant year that's quickly established the café as a solid venue for great art exhibitions,
poetry, folk, soul, jazz, rock and experimental music. Notable additions to our intimate café space thus
far have included Jono McCleery, Tanya Auclair, Daisy Beau, Nathaniel Robin Mann and Julia Biel, as well
as local acts and events including The Lovebirds, Breezy & the Spaceshipman, Cloudier Skies, Franck & Dani,
Kellie Gillespie, Joe Duggan & RPM Club, some of whom will perform as part of the festival programme.

Daily, we're known for brewing great filter and Aeropress coffee with beans from Volcano, Brett & Bailey's now
infamous baked goods, an eclectic and somewhat experimental bagel menu and a fully stocked bar including a
selection of Ales and Antenna specials such as our refreshing Cucumber G&T.

The Café Thing whose name reflects the Icelandic roots of the studios director and means 'meeting place,' also
frequently hosts ecologically and environmentally minded events and workshops from Goldsmith's students and CP’s
Transition Town. Not without a huge amount of gratitude from us, they, The Secret Garden, local residents, friends
and Capital Growth have supported us in our efforts to green the Antenna Studios Yard which is now home to a whole
host of edible plants and flowers that when harvested will find their way into our drinks and food menu. We're
proud to serve the traders, shoppers and perusers at Crystal Palace's buzzing Local Food Market situated in the
car park next to Antenna Studios every Saturday from 10am-3pm.

It's the magic and talent of CP's magnetic triangle that motivates and drives us and it's this that, with your
help, we aim to celebrate as part of the Crystal Palace Overground Festival this year.
