Building on their involvement with the festival in previous years, we are pleased to announce
[Smash Bang Wallop][1] as the main sponsor of our (bursting at the seams!) Kids' Zone, taking place at 
Westow Park on Saturday, June 29.

Not only will the kids be busy with a record number of activities – [Kid's zone preview][2] - taking place, but Smash Bang
Wallop are playing host to a huge array of festival activities themselves, with their passion for dinosaurs
at the heart of everything!

'Dinosaurs are the love of our life!', says owner Liz Clamp. 'Our shop just isn't complete without them!
Whether they are featured on a t-shirt, a birthday gift, or are a plush soft toy, we can't survive a day
without one hanging out in the shop somewhere!

'We will be letting one out on Saturday to visit the activities tent in Westow Park!'

'Don't forget to pop by to our Crystal Palace themed stall outside our shop on Westow Street  on your way to the park.
We'll also be selling Ray Stanbrook tea towels, cards and prints, as well as launching a (currently) top secret t-shirt!'

'We're also part of the triangle traders day on Sunday, where a £50 gift voucher will be awarded to the person who
can identify the age or designer of a number of specially selected items located around the store'.

'We are really excited about the Festival, it's a fabulous community event bringing new people to the area and
reminding the rest of us why we've made Crystal Palace our home. Each year it gets better and better so go forth;
listen to the music, eat the food, shop the shops and bask in the atmosphere that is Crystal Palace'.
