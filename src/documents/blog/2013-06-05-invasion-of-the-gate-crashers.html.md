Like all the best ideas it started with some gate-crashing.

Spoke yesterday to El Crisis and David J Pugilist, the two guys who gate-crashed our last Spoken Word event and left
us all reeling with their word play. Very hard to pin down their styles: David has a hyperactive delivery with strange
pauses and jumps, almost like someone is mixing him live.  Despite having played some of the biggest venues in
spoken word, including Glastonbury and Random Acts on Channel 4, he's very excited about playing at the festival
with his partner in rhyme El Crisis.  I think he's starting to pick up on the Crystal Palace magic. El Crisis is
very hard to define too: hip hop, chanting and a hint of old spiritual, there's something hypnotic going on. You
might have heard him on BBC Radio, caught him at Glastonbury or on Sky Arts.

After they finished gate-crashing so eloquently we knew we had to have them back. And get a bigger space!
So we've decided to pull out the stops for our Overground Special on Friday 28 June at 7:30pm so its now upstairs
in [Antenna Studios][1]. The spoken word events at [Antenna Café Thing][2] have been building momentum for the last few months
and it's time for a best of the best night with some of the most exciting performers we've had so far. There's even
more to celebrate as this Overground Festival is happening a year after the Café Thing launched. Hard to believe
that this venue, with Georgie Cooke at the helm, which has built up such a reputation for intimate music and spoken
word gigs, has only been going for a year!

As well as David J Pugilist and El Crisis we are asking back a host of great performers:

>   Tamsin Kendrick featured on our first night and danced a clever line between all her different identities: Croydon
    woman, Oxford graduate and a definite hint of Jessica Rabbit. Highly commended in the Forward Prize and featured at
    Latitude "Explores the terrains of love and faith with unflinching directness and refreshing honesty" Niall O'Sullivan

>   The Jazzman has entered the building: Jazzman John Clarke has won over crowds all over London with his sheer enthusiasm
    and energy, and we keep asking him back!  "When it's good, jazz poetry is really goosebumpy, joyous stuff. 
    And Jazzman is one of the best we've seen" The Londonist

>   Kellie Gillespie took us to some strange places last time, and left us reeling, laughing and chained to her bedposts. 
    Her kinky karaoke of ex-lovers as performed by the audience was something to behold! "One of the most exciting 21st 
    century writers in the UK" Edward Timon, The Erotic Review

As well as hosting, I will also do a few poems myself ..."Under the chatty vernacular is a lovely, casual sharpness. 
Joe's poetry is like an unexpected hot chilli in something sold as sweet" Cherry Smith, Poetry Editor Brand Magazine. 
Cherry always had great taste.

And one of the really special things about these nights have been the brilliant open-mic slots: local people 
getting up and taking a chance and reminding us again what a ridiculously talented area Crystal Palace is. 
Well one of our open mic-ers needs a feature slot so Zulie Stenson, who moved us with her beautifully honest and 
intimate love poems will be treating us to more.  We also have a limited number of open mic-slots available – email 
me at <joeduggan215@hotmail.com>  for more info.

So where will you be on Friday 28 June and what better way could you set yourself up for the rest of this brilliant festival?
