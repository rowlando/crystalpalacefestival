Every year the festival likes to refresh its identity, and with the assistance of three very talented local Crystal 
Palace designers, they came up with year's design, which bases its origins firmly in Vintage Crystal Palace and 
its 1970s musical heyday.

Rick Walker (graffiti artist), Graeme Dalton (fine arts) and Gillian Hibbs (illustrator) all brought their own 
unique styles together to create the live and vibrant, typography based design.

Creative director of Paintshop Studio, Rick Walker, said: "I have always been a fan of the festival and it's 
been great to be involved and work with some of the other creative people in the area.

"We all wanted to get involved, and it was a great experience to combine our ideas, influences and skills. It 
really was a collaborative effort and started by agreeing to go down a typographic route for the design.

"Each of us sketched out hand-drawn typefaces onto tracing paper and then met to overlay them and see what 
combinations worked.

"I then photographed these and brought them into the computer to create the layout, detail text and add the 
colour. The process of photographing hand drawn images tends to give a very nice natural feel to the design.

"This was a new approach for us all, but it seemed like a very natural and organic way to design and felt 
really appropriate for the Crystal Palace Overground Festival."

We feel the new branding really hits the mark in appealing to a very diverse audience – quite a difficult brief 
to nail, but the team did a brilliant job and we are thrilled with this vibrant homage to Crystal Palace past and present.
