    We have a rare treat in store for Crystal Palace lovers and historians of the wondrous palace
    itself – our open air cinema at Coopers Yard

**Stop press!** A new addition to our programme – *The Library (2012)* – a short animated film by Leo Crane. This 4-minute
computer animation takes the viewer into their fantasies to share in what could happen if library etiquette
is overridden by carnal urges.


We have a rare treat in store for Crystal Palace lovers and historians of the wondrous palace
itself – our open air cinema at [Coopers Yard][1] will show *The Pleasure Garden* (1953),
a BBC short film, on its 60th anniversary. Filmed among the ruins of the Crystal Palace terraces, The
Pleasure Garden is a poetic ode to desire. Made by the American poet James Broughton, the film features
Hattie Jacques and Lindsay Anderson, with John le Mesurier as the bureaucrat determined to stamp out
any form of free expression. Lovers of the history of Crystal Palace will find much to treasure in this
time capsule of a film, which shows the Crystal Colonnade and the bandstand (both later demolished), the
Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Memorial, and much of the statuary that was to be auctioned off in 1957.

This special event will be followed a screening of the Oscar nominated, BAFTA winning short, *A Morning Stroll*
by Crystal Palace’s own Grant Orchard. This animated short film tells the story of one New Yorker’s early
morning encounter with a chicken, an event that plays out over 100 years...

This special event will be followed by the main feature *Little Miss Sunshine*. What happens when you stuff a failed
motivation speaker, his wife, the nation's number one Proust scholar, an elderly potty-mouthed heroin addict, a
teen who's mute by choice, and a bespectacled little pageant hopeful into a mini VW bus for a three day road trip?
You get this hilarious but moving satire about a dysfunctional family obsessed with winning.
