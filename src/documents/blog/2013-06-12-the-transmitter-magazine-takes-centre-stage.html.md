Theatrics, curiosities, and delights, have been blended perfectly with this year's [Performing Arts tent][1] sponsored by 
[The Transmitter magazine][2], which takes to the stage at Westow Park on Saturday June 29. 

"We are over the top happy to be sponsoring the Performance Art Tent, which will be showcasing an eclectic mix 
of local talent and oddities, just like the magazine really!" states editor Andy Pontin.

Nestled at the bottom of Westow Park, you will be transported back to a Victorian era with the talented cast 
performing their very own and original interpretation of 'The Great Exhibition', which lies at the very 
heart of Crystal Palace!

The Transmitter itself is also helping spread the word of the festival far and wide, "The summer festival 
themed issue hits the streets Friday June 14, and includes a 12 page festival 'What's on Guide'. I'm really 
pleased with this issue and it looks great, thanks to our designer Simon Sharville", adds Andy.

"The Transmitter has been 100% behind Noreen Meehan, chair of the festival, since she got involved, and we 
have been a sponsor since the first Overground festival.  It's been great to watch her from the sidelines 
magnificently managing to produce such fabulous and well organised events. The Transmitter is unilaterally 
declaring independence for Crystal Palace next issue and we are going to recommend Noreen as our first Queen, 
even though she is technically foreign.  

I see the festival as one of the 'planks' in the Crystal Palace structure, one of a growing number of cultural 
reference points that help people feel a part of something. 

Alongside hanging out near the Performance Art Tent, watching all the fun, and soaking up the atmosphere, I'm 
looking forward to seeing Metamono on the [music stage][3]. We've featured them in this month's edition of
the Transmitter, and I'm very much looking forward to watching them live for the first time."
