<p>The Crystal Palace Overground Festival is run by a dedicated team of volunteers. Everyone, including the musicians,
artists and performers, donate their time and talent for free. </p>

<p>Volunteers have an enormous impact on the health and well-being of communities. It sounds rather clichéd, but the
festival really wouldn't happen without them. </p>

<p>Crystal Palace resident Karen Pernyes has volunteered for the festival for the past 3 years, here's her story.</p>

<p>"I first became involved in 2011, a few months before the first festival in Westow Park," says Karen. </p>

<p>"I work closely with the festival director, Noreen Meehan, to make the event a success. From working together to set
up and run the open community consultation, writing the job descriptions of all the key organisational roles, to
taking on the specific role this year of operations director for the main outdoor event at Westow Park on Saturday 29 June."</p>

<p>"On the day I will be the one in Festival HQ glued to the end of a two-way radio!"</p>

<p>"But it's not about taking on as much as I or others take on, we need every bit of help we can."</p>

<p>"Volunteering at the festival is a wonderful way for the whole community to come together, even if it's just
sticking up a few posters in a local school, helping for a few hours on the day, spreading the word, supporting
the events and traders, or lending a hand to organise next years event, so that we can have many more great festivals ahead of us!" </p>

<p>"Volunteering gives a huge sense of pride and achievement - there is nothing better than seeing the looks on all
the volunteers faces on the day with a sense of 'I did this, I was part of this, I helped make this happen'." </p>

<p>Thank you to our brilliant team of festival volunteers.</p>
