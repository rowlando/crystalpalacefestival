The top of Westow Park is set to be transformed into an oasis of tranquility on Saturday 29 June, as our holistic 
tent, sponsored by [The Little Escape][1], offers a little escape from it all!

"The Little Escape is a team holistic therapy project, a group of people with lots of different training and
 experience, but who are all passionate in believing that wellbeing is something to share and to strive towards" says 
 acupuncturist and business owner Lilja Katanka. "We work together in genuinely wanting to help individuals find the 
 right treatment for them at that time, and working together works so well both for the practitioners and the 
 patients - so it is holistic on lots of levels! We want to offer a place for people to learn about their own health 
 and bodies, and to be able to relax and just generally feel better."

There are so many activities taking place throughout the day you won't want to leave..! 

"We'll be offering taster treatments of chair massage and Indian head massage, which are festival favourites, Shiatsu 
stretches and sleep and relaxation workshops, a free Sound Bath session, mini reflexology, and facial tasters," says Lilja.

"Alongside our specialists, who will be on hand to answer any questions you have, Veronica Massa will be displaying her 
beautiful handmade organic aromaceutical products for face and body, [Massaholistics][2]; we'll be running a free
prize draw, and offering discounts on a range of therapies and products."

Despite being a relatively new business in Crystal Palace this is their second year of being a festival sponsor. 

"We jumped at the chance to be platinum sponsors as it's such a fantastic event that gets the whole area involved, 
we're really happy to support this."

"For us it's really important to meet people, so that we can explain what we do and show that we're real people who
 are passionate about our work, and our involvement with the community. I also think that when people are curious 
 about treatments or therapies it can be intimidating, so we love having the opportunity to give advice or 
 recommendations, and encourage questions." 

"Personally I can't wait for the festival! I was brought up in Crystal Palace, and I'm constantly amazed and 
impressed at how much it's changed over the years... it feels like the festival is a celebration of this evolution..!"
