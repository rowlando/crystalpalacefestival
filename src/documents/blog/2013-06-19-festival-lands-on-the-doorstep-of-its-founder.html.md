The festival has a debt of gratitude to owner of [Bambinos][1], Andy Stem, who started
our wonderful festival, now in its seventh year. Needing a bit of a coffee break from our last minute preparations
we popped in for a chat with one of our gold sponsors&hellip;

Coffee is a popular new edition to this unconventional shop, thanks to specialist barista Ant, who recently took up 
residence in the front of the shop launching Bambino Coffee. Whilst we chat delicious single origin coffee is brewed 
to perfection in a refurbished ‘60's lever machine.

"We have a thing for the weird and strange", begins Andy, who has been running his emporium of second hand goods, 
curiosities, LPs, trinkets, literature, gadgets, antiques, and vintage leathers on Church Road for the last 22 years.  

"We like unusual search requests. For example we were asked to find an old-fashioned respiratory system for a West 
End show, so managed to source this one from the early 1960s."

"I love being involved with the festival", continues Andy, "as I used to organise it and it’s a brilliant way to 
get everyone together from musicians to artists to local businesses&hellip; it just needs facilitation."

"Ironically I haven’t managed to see much of previous festivals due to organising them, but you won’t be able to 
keep me away from the [vintage hub][2], taking place 100 yards from us. I’m also particularly looking forward to seeing 
Metamono on the [main stage][3] - Mark from the group sells vinyl in my basement"

"As a local business it’s an honour and a privilege to support the festival as I feel there is a need to 
put back into the community. As a local resident I feel it brings everyone together providing a few days of 
joy which everyone needs. It also brings a lot of new people to Crystal Palace, who fall in love with it too."
