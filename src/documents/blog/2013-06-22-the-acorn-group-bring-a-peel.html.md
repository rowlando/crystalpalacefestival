The world's smallest car, a [PEEL][1], is headlining a weekend of activities
by our lead sponsor, the Acorn Group, which celebrates its third year of support for the festival.

"We have loads going on this year, and are very much looking forward to everyone getting involved", says director of
Acorn's Crystal Palace office, James Clow, as we catch up with what they have in store.

"Our star attraction, the Peel car, will be delivered to Westow Park for our stall on Saturday 29 June and will be
positioned by the main stage. We would love for our visitors to squeeze in and have their photo taken! In addition
we have a full sized red door for you to Guess which key fits in the lock.  We will be asking for a donation of £1 to
play, with all proceeds going to St Mungo's homeless charity, and any winners will be presented with a bottle of bubbly.

We value being part of our community, and this festival allows us to show our support, and give something back. We
like to use our local knowledge and influence to support charity and sponsorship projects. Only earlier this month
our CEO cycled 100km for charity!

I'm looking forward to meeting as many people as possible, and making sure everyone who visits our stall on the
Saturday, or our Acorn Branch on Sunday at 29 Westow Street, has a fantastic experience. Personally sampling some
of the delicious cakes we're having made by local business Brett & Bailey Bakery for our Sunday stall is a highlight. 
There are plenty to go around, so we look forward to sharing them with our visitors.

We hope the sun is shining to show support of all the hard work that's gone into this year's festival, although we
will be out rain or shine, and look forward to what promises to be another successful Crystal Palace event."
