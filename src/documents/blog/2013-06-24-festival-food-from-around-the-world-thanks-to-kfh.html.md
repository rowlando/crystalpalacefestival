Global gastronomic delights will be on offer at our dedicated [food court][1] in Westow Park on Saturday June 29, all 
thanks to its sponsor [Kinleigh Folkard & Hayward's Estate Agents][2]. Feeling a bit peckish we nipped in to find out more&hellip;

With improvements underway at their Crystal Palace branch, which has a prime location on Westow Hill, KFH have 50 
branches throughout London. "Embedding ourselves within the local community is a fundamental part of our business, 
and very close to our hearts", states Tyrone Eneh, Crystal Palace Sales Manager. 

"The festival is a fantastic way to bring local residents and visitors closer together, so we're looking forward to 
all that it offers. Overall I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone there and meeting new faces. In particular 
the [Comedy at the Café][3] on Thursday evening should be loads of fun, as will the [open air cinema][4] on Friday night."

Nestled at the bottom end of Westow Hill, past the [music stage][5] and next to the [Performing Arts tent][6], you will be 
spoilt for choice from the food and beverages on offer&hellip;

To ease into the day relax with a coffee from the Crystal Palace based [Braziliana café][7] or Café Santiago, accompanied
by a pastry from the [Blackbird Bakery][8] . Missed breakfast? Not to worry visit [Original Fry up material][9] for 
everything from muesli to a full hearty breakfast.

[The Tartlettes][10] with their cakes and savoury tarts will keep appetites at bay, if you can't wait for lunch!

Did someone mention lunch? Asian from Monk 29, West Indian thanks to Little Honeybeez, Turkish wraps and Hog Roast
from [Neriman Sandwiches][11], and a touch of the Caribbean visits SE19 courtesy of Kerry's Real Jerk.

A little closer to UK borders tuck into Austrian street food, meats and sandwiches from the [Fleisch Mob][12]; French 
crepes from La Boheme French Creperie, Tartiflette from La Tartiflette; Spanish Tapas from the [Flying Tapas][13] team, 
and Italian inspired pizza from the back of [Bosco and Bee's][14] little Piaggio Ape van!

We haven't forgotten festival favourites, with [Jacob Ladder Foods][15] and [Mama Vastys][16] offering a range of organic 
burgers and natural spicy delights. For a much lighter alternative Comfort and Joy will be on hand with a range of
wholesome deli delicacies.

Peppered with sweet treats from Kodi Cupcake, [Crystal Creams][18] Italian gelato, [Drum & Kernel Popcorn][19], not 
forgetting fresh oysters from the exquisite [Oyster Meister][20], the food court simply has it all!
