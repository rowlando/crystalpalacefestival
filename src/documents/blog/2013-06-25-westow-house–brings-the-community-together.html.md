A festival is not quite the same with out a bar, and thanks to our gold sponsors [Westow House][1], we have all bases
covered. Organising a festival is thirsty work, so we just had to nip in for a drink.

You can't miss Westow House in Crystal Palace, which sits at the far end of Westow Hill, a stone's throw from Crystal
Palace Park, and at a juncture of the Crystal Palace triangle itself. "The pub used to be called the White Swan,"
begins general manager Justin Hutton, "and was built in the 1880s. Originally it was a three storey building, until
a stray bomb in WW2 took off the top layer of the pub. We have recently got planning permission to rebuild the
third storey, to bring Westow House back to its former glory, but no date has been set for this yet." 

"Westow House loves to get involved in as many community things as possible, so being a sponsor for the festival
was a no brainer for us. We are always willing to try and help out community groups and initiatives as much as we
can." (We feel a bit spoilt in fact, as we have held a couple of festival meetings at the pub, and also recently
launched our 'What's on Guide', courtesy of Justin's hospitality. Thanks!)

"We have a full line up of events this year, taking place both at the pub and right next to the
[Food Court][2], at the bottom of Westow Park, past the [main stage][3]." So here's a round up of Westow
House's festival events – they are all over this week's programme:

**Thursday 27 June** -
6 course, 7 beers night with guest speaker Rod Jones from [Meantime Brewing Company][4] with tickets only £50 (including
food and drink), which can be brought on-line here http://www.wegottickets.com/event/221180 or at the bar.

**Friday 28 June** -
1950s rock 'n' roll night, with live music from the Boom Boom Booms, and a period jukebox playing hits of the era.
Dance the night away with swing and jive lessons, play pinball machines, drink alcoholic milkshakes, and be blown
away by our huge range of hotdogs!!

**Saturday 29 June at Westow House** -
Hog roast, BBQ, cider festival
Live music in the garden from 5:30pm featuring Loose Joints, Brother/Sister, Valve Control and The Stone Faced Travellers
DJ Christos until 2am.

**Saturday 29 June in Westow Park** -
Relax on a Chesterfield couch, play foosball table and giant Jenga, whilst enjoying our own craft beer and cider bar.

**Sunday 30 June** -
Hog roast, BBQ, cider festival and live music in the garden all day.

Justin continued, "I'm really looking forward to having the bar in Westow Park, as it's the first time Westow House has
got to be involved in the park area, so it brings a whole new dimension to the festival for us. We are looking forward
to this year being the biggest and best Crystal Palace Overground Festival yet, with the incorporation of the traders
on Sunday too. We hope that everyone has a great festival. See you at the bar!!" See you there, Justin.
