We are proud to feature a phenomenal line up on our [main stage][1] in Westow Park on Saturday 29 June this year. From
soloists, up and coming young bands, to analogue synths, we have it all. To whet your appetite, with less than a

## Emerging music making quite a stir&hellip;

Having beaten 35,000 entrants to win the PRS For Music Songwriting Award at the Next BRIT thing, [Floodliners][2] are
an indie band to watch. The five piece from South London are not letting their youth, 16–19, stand in their way of musical success.

"Our music has taken us places we wouldn't of dreamt of going - ranging from the BRIT Awards after party, the Borderline
and Barfly, alongside a load of other great gigs –such as the 100 Club, 229 Club, Indigo Rooms and Carling Academy.
It was great doing a live session on Gaby Roslin/Paul Ross's breakfast show on BBC Radio London...and fun making live
and promo videos.

We all have contrasting styles and musical influences ranging from Beyonce, Pharrell, Netsky to Daft Punk....and some
punky stuff in between...but we don't let our influences dictate the music that we make.

On Saturday expect lots of energy, fun, female power, glamour, and some serious festival vibe! We're looking forward
to relaxing, getting out in the sunshine (hopefully) and spreading some Flood love."

Here at festival HQ there was just one last question we had to ask, "is there anyone we might know following you on Twitter?"

"We have a growing fan base including the Backstreet Boys, Divinity Roxx (Beyonce's bass player), Ed Sheeran, and
McFly." (We have some catching up to do!)

Catch Floodliners on the [main music stage][1] in Westow Park at 12 noon.

## Offbeat South

[Offbeat South][3] recently won the Pizza Express Big Audition with Jamie Cullum, a national
competition open to aspiring singers, songwriters and musicians. Since then the Croydon based urban/pop/electro/rock
band, friends since their uni days and still in their early twenties, have been busy making big waves.

"Winning the Big Audition has been a major highlight of our career so far", vocalist Anton told us. "It gave us the
confidence to take music seriously as a band. More recently we have been in the studio writing and producing our
first five track EP, which we will be giving away at the festival. BBC Introducing rapper Little Simz is featured on it.

It means a lot to play in such a big local event, and we were ecstatic when we found out we were playing, as we
wanted to be involved last year, but were too late in applying.

Expect us to bring good vibes, energy and fun times, whilst we're all looking forward to getting some food!"

Catch Offbeat South on the [main music stage][1] in Westow Park at 1:20pm.
