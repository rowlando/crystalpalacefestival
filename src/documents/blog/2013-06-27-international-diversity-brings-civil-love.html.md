Our third act appearing on the main music stage on Saturday June 29 in Westow Park at 12.40pm, is south London
based Civil Love.  

**Civil Love is an intriguing name for a band, how did it come about?**

"I came up with the name ages ago when I was a law student in Spain", begins vocalist and drummer Dan. "There was 
this professor who faked accents every time he quoted foreign terms saying "Civil Love" instead of "Civil Law", and 
a friend and I decided that if we ever formed a pop band we would call it Civil Love. But we'll actually be changing 
the name as soon as we come up with the right one."

**How would describe your music, and where do you get your musical inspirations from?**

"Just very melodic '60s and '70s inspired pop-rock, with hints of '90s alternative, and a bit of C86 and jangle pop 
maybe. We're influenced by a lot of bands we feel cool listening to – Teenage Fanclub, Big Star, Byrds, Fleetwood Mac, 
Tom Petty, Beach House, and some we feel uncool listening to like ABBA, Maroon 5, Prefab Sprout."

**How did you all meet, and where in the world are you from?**

"We met on the Internet, like all modern relationships. I'm from Canada, Urko is from Spain, Chris from Scotland, and 
Dave is English. When we're not playing music we like to poke fun at each others' accents."

**What can we expect from your set at the festival?**

"Quite laid back and summery."

**What does being part of the festival mean to you?**

"We all live south of the river (except for Chris who lives in Hackney and wears tight trousers), so this is local 
to us. We like the idea of being part of an authentic, local event."

**What are you looking forward to the most over the four days?**

"Food! Also definitely a couple of beers, some music of course, and meeting some interesting locals and creative 
types. Oh, and the table tennis tournament. We're surprisingly good."
