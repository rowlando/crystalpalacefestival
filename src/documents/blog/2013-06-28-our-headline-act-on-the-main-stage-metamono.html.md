    Instrumental funk is set to bring the whole of Westow Park to its feet as The Hornets, an eight piece funk collective
    of professional musicians, take to the main stage on Saturday 29 June at 3:05pm. With their final preparations well
    underway we visited The Hornets Hive to discover what the buzz was about.

As the name suggests, [Metamono][1], a local Crystal Palace three piece band are into analogue in a big way! Following their
strict adherence to their ‘manifesto’ they will never do quite a lot of things, including using a microphone or
any mechanical sound generation, instead analogue is King, from analogue electronic sound generation and processing,
to building and playing their own instruments.

Before their headline appearance at 5pm Saturday June 29 on the [main stage][2] in Westow Park, we caught up with
Mark to find out more.

**What are the origins of your unique creative style?**

“Another planet of the imagination, uniquely observed by avid fan and ‘The Quietus’ journalist David Stubbs.”

**You may build some of your own equipment, but where does the rest come from?**

“We prefer to think that the individual parts of the instrumentarium gravitate to us as and when needed, cosmic ordering
service type approach.”

**What’s your dream piece of equipment that you don’t currently have?**

“The Tardis central console probably, though we have all toyed with the idea of playing with Delia Derbyshire's Wobulator
at some time or other! (For the uninitiated, the origins of the unmistakable sound of the original Dr Who theme tune).

The Tardis central console may take a bit of time to reach us, but helping us release our debut double album on vinyl
in a gatefold sleeve, would simply be [With the compliments of Nuclear Physics][3], which everyone
can help us achieve now.”

**What can we expect from your set at the festival?**

“On Saturday expect a metamono moshpit style finale to the show, with t-shirt sales going through the roof!”

**What are all personally looking forward to the most?**

Jono: “Beer!”<br>
Mark: “My daughter Frida's 16th birthday”<br>
Paul: “LUNCH all four days!”<br>

**What does being part of the festival mean to you all?**

“Seriously though, it’s quite humbling being part of the festival in such a big way, and good to give something back to the locals who have supported us so well. So thank you Crystal Palace and pray for sunshine!”
