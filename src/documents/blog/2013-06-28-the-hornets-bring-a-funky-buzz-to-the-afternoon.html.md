Instrumental funk is set to bring the whole of Westow Park to its feet as [The Hornets][1],
an eight piece funk collective of professional musicians, take to the [main music stage][2] on Saturday 29
June at 3:05pm. With their final preparations well underway we visited The Hornets Hive to discover what the buzz was about&hellip;

"Get ready for 45 minutes of no-holds-barred, full-on FUNK from some of London's finest funk musicians, playing pure
dirt from Billy Brookes to Breakestra. This funk is served RARE!," the opening words from the shy and retiring co-founder
Russ, leaving us in no doubt we're in for a real treat.

"We are very proud to be part of this fantastic festival," continues Russ, "and are really glad that we have been invited
to contribute. It's a highlight in a buzzy year for us! We're particularly looking forward to the music stage and
the food on offer."

**The visit to the hive seems to have created quite a stir, and seconds later we are surrounded by 16 Hornets! Not
really sure we should be asking, but how is the final line up going to be decided?**

"It basically has nothing to do with us. You see there's this Queen. She is massive and runs the whole show. We
just do what we're told." 

When booking THE HORNETS for funk gigs, the Queen considers many factors that may influence our effectiveness
whilst 'in the field'. These considerations range from interpreting the forecast meteorological data for the date
in question, (wind speed/direction, atmospheric pressure, pollen count, etc) to estimating the scale of potential
human contact, i.e. number of 'targets', potential sting quotas, availability of said target's alcohol/food etc.
These measures guarantee not only a rigorous selection process for the most appropriate HORNET for each gig, but
also ensures the selected HORNET has sufficient field data to implement his mission targets effectively and (if possible)
return to the HIVE safely.

In this case, She has chosen:

* H0001 - Tenor Sax/Flute
* H0002 - Trumpet 
* H2865 - Alto/Baritone Sax
* H1089 - Trombone
* H6412 - Drums
* H7995 - Bass
* H3578 - Guitar
* H2220 - Keyboards

**H6412, H3578 &hellip;how in heavens did this group of Hornets meet?**

"The Queen digs The Funk so THE HORNETS were hatched!!!"

**After a few minutes in the Hornets Hive I sense there may be a sting in their tail&hellip;**

"While THE HORNETS are on stage distracting you all with top-quality funk, an army of Drone HORNETS will carry out a 
calculated assault on your picnic hampers. 
 
You had better hope that She doesn't call in the heavy artillery (remember the recent invasion of Asian Red Hornets?)
or you'll all be right done for. Once we're done funking you all silly, we'll join in with them, drink your beer, eat
your picnic, and buzz off back to THE HIVE. You could consider that 'getting off lightly' we suppose. Don't forget
the Savlon!"

**&hellip;as they sum up what they have planned**

"It's a reasonable opportunity to have a 'bit-of-a-sting-fest', gorge ourselves silly on your cider, cold sausages
and other picnic grub you may have on offer, and hopefully annoy quite a lot of people". 

**None of the four day festival seems to be safe!**

"Four days? That's a tenth of our entire lives! We just wanna sting people and nick all your cider!"
