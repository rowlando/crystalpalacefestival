Loved locally and beyond for her outstanding vocal abilities and soulful presence, [Breezy Lee][1] is performing both
on Saturday 29 June on the [main music stage][2] in Westow Park, and with her full band The Spaceshipman on Sunday
30 June at [Antenna Studios][3].

Our guest blogger Drumzofthesouth caught up with her to find out more&hellip;

**What can people who've not heard you music before expect?**

“Soulful, folky, trip-hoppy yumminess! I'm influenced by people like Tanya Auclair, Jono McCleery, Hidden Orchestra,
 Lianne la Havas; older influences are things like Bjork, David Bowie, Radiohead, Portishead&hellip;”

**You said you were quite influenced by rock when you were younger?**

“Yes, I was brought up on rock. My parents are in a punk band, Lost In Space, so I grew up listening to punk, David Bowie, Ozzy Osbourne, David Lee Roth, Bauhaus (breaks into Bela Lugosi's Dead).”

**What do you think of the music industry at the moment?**

“I think it sucks as always but there are some great musicians out and about at the moment. I like the fact that music
is very accessible, you don't have to just digest what's in the charts, cos what's in the charts is pretty rubbish in
my opinion, so it's really nice to be able to listen to good music on things like Soundcloud and the like.”

**What do you think of the south London music scene, particularly Crystal Palace?**

“It’s very colourful, vibrant, exciting and diverse, with all ages included. But I think there should be a dedicated
live music venue – a venue rather than pubs where bands can play. The best place at the moment to see live music is
Antenna Cafe Thing, ‘cos of the vibe. Anyone who has played there, big or small, has loved it. I’ve always had a great
response, because people come and listen to the music rather than concentrating on drinking.”

**Are you looking forward to the Crystal Palace Overground Festival?**

“I'm very much looking forward to it. I've been pretty much every year since it's been on. It's super, way better
than Glastonbury. No mud, no queuing 10 hours for the toilets, and round the corner from my house. It's great! I'm very
 excited about playing. I’ve got a new band together, and I think they're all excited too.”

**What's it like playing music with your partner?**

“It’s magical, beautiful, wonderful, intimidating and scary all at the same time! It's extra special writing and
creating something with someone that you love. It's almost more special, but also scary, because if you're writing
a song about that person it can be embarrassing.”

**Considering your parents are musical, do you think your vocal talent is a result of nature or nurture?**

“Oh, it's both, definitely. I get my power, stage presence and confidence from my mum, who has always been very
confident. I've grown up seeing that, so that's sort of why I feel so relaxed on stage. But nurture as well, as we've
got completely different styles. I was lucky enough to go to the Brit School, where I was able to be very creative and
meet lots of other creative people. Over the years the influences have played a big part on how my voice and style are.”

**What's your dream gig?**

“It would be David Bowie, Björk and Thom Yorke as backing singers at Brixton Academy, with Rage Against The Machine
and Radiohead to support, and Skin making a guest appearance.”

**What are you looking forward to at the festival?**

“Playing on the Sunday with lots of good friends, The Popcorn stall!, which is my friend Sharon's stall, and maybe
getting a massage at The Little Escape. I'm also looking for an outfit from the local shops, so if anyone sees
anything get in touch!”
