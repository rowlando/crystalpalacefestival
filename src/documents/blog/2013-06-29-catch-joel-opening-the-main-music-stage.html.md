Our first act on the main music stage at Westow Park today, is up and coming singer song writer [Joel Bullen][1]. We caught 
up with him to find out more&hellip;
 
**Youâ€™re opening the festival! How did you feel when you found out?**
 
"It will be great to start off the day on the main stage, people will be sober so therefore able to remember me! (I hope)"
 
**You gig regularly around Crystal Palace, how will this compare?**
 
"I play many gigs around Crystal Palace, this one is going to be my first Outdoor gig there, and I am expecting there
to be far more people in the audience than usual."
 
**What can we expect from your set at the Festival?**
 
"I will be playing with all my emotions, with a set which will include the eerie, the happy, and the Grungy side 
of me! I hope the crowd can connect with my set."
 
**What does being part of the festival mean to you?**
 
"It is great to be part of the line up, along with some great up and coming talent from the area."
 
**What are you looking forward to over the weekend?**
 
"I am looking forward to playing more than anything else really. Once I have played I will look forward to relaxing 
and checking out all kinds of diverse acts."
