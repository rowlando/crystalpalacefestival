Wow well what can I say? I am still on a high (or is that an adrenalin rush?) from the festival, as I sit down to write
this. As chair of the festival, and its overall director, I feel a big responsibility to make sure everyone has as good
a time as possible, and we get as many people from our lovely community involved. I really feel we were even more
successful this year in achieving this.

Each year has been very special, so it’s not a case of choosing my favourite, which would be impossible anyway, but
some highlights for me this year were: the main music stage line up, our very first performing arts tent, a veritable
kids’ festival within the festival, and so much more happening outside of the park, which is a part of the festival
very close to my heart.

All four days were busy, with a diverse programme of events, from comedy at Crystal Palace railway station, wonderful
events in our pubs and venues, to a very sunny Sunday line up, which included our first vintage hub, and spontaneous
gigs happening on the streets of the Triangle. Seeing The Hipster Ray pop up on Church Road to play an impromptu gig
outside Cartwright’s was just lovely – everyone was standing around on both sides of the road grinning from ear to ear!
I heard that the band playing on The White Hart’s roof were amazing. I spent Sunday evening at Café Thing at Antenna,
winding down with a few festival buddies and some Pimms, seeing wonderful hurdy gurdy music and spoken word from
Joe Duggan, followed by The Lovebirds. Very tired, but very happy and proud.

I hope everyone had a great time, and I want to say a huge thank you to all who got involved, the incredible volunteers
who made it happen, the amazing performers throughout the whole festival, the sponsors and advertisers, as without
their support we couldn’t afford to put this event on, Croydon Council for allowing us to use Westow Park, the great
traders, venues/pubs and community groups of Crystal Palace, all the stallholders, Big Lottery, the Community
Development Foundation and Lambeth Council for funding us, our local councillors for their support, LAStheatre for
the great production of the performing arts tent, SLR for big phat sound on the main music stage, Project Shine for
festival infrastructure, all the festival bars for watering everyone, and I hope that I haven’t forgotten anyone.
Til next year, thanks *so* much everyone!
