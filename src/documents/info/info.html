<p>You can find out all the information you need about the festival by navigating through the website, checking out
all of the pages on each day of the event – <a href="/whats-on/thursday-27-june">Thursday 27 June</a>,
<a href="/whats-on/friday-28-june">Friday 28 June</a>,
<a href="/whats-on/saturday-29-june">Saturday 29 June</a> and <a href="/whats-on/sunday-30-june">Sunday 30 June</a>. We
will be adding more content on the website over the next week going into more
detail on the events  – please check back and keep on surfing! </p>

<p>We are also busy updating our festival app but you can download last year’s by searching for Crystal Palace
Overground Festival in the iTunes store and then download the update when it’s ready. Apologies to Android users
but we haven’t got the resources to produce the app for that platform too.</p>

<p>Printed guides will be available around the Triangle from 14 June so please pop into a shop or pub and pick
one up! They will also be available from festival information points on Saturday 29 June in Westow Park and
on Sunday 30 June on Westow Street.</p>
