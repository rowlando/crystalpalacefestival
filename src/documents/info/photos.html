<h2>That's all folks!</h2>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has taken part in the festival - punters, volunteers, sponsors, traders, musicians, dancers, artists,
actors, performers, foodies, the local community, Westow Park, pubs, the weather, shopkeepers and their staff, festival
committee, operations peeps&hellip; the list goes on</p>

<h2>Your photos</h2>

<p>We're really keen to see your pics of the festival. We have set up a Flickr group where you can
share your memories of festival. You'll need to join the group before you can add pics to the group (and Flickr, if you're
not a member already). There's lots going on over the 4 days and there's no way we can capture everything, so please
contribute your favourite snaps via Flickr &ndash; Thank you!</p>

    to our Flickr account after the festival, so do remember to come back, share and comment on our pics.</p>
