            <h3>Join the really useful team today!</h3>
            <p>We need all kinds of like-minded people to volunteer and help make the 8th Crystal Palace Overground Festival bigger and better than ever before.</p>

            <p>Jobs include stage stewards, programme distributors, experienced crowd controllers and donation collectors.</p>

            <p>Our volunteers usually work a 4-hour shift across any of the 4 days of the festival, from a fringe event around the Crystal Palace Triangle to Westow Park itself. If you have time or a skill we can use it!</p>

            <h3>Help make the 2014 festival the best one yet!</h3>
            <p>Applicants must be aged 18+ and be able to commit to working a 4-hour shift. In return we offer training, a certificate for your participation, good times and an opportunity to meet new friends, whilst making Crystal Palace an even better place to live!</p>
