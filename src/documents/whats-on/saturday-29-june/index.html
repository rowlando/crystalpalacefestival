<p>Saturday features the big park event in Westow Park with more festival shenanigans than ever before!
    Our kids’ zone [link to kids’ zone page] is situated up by the Church Road entrance to the park and
    has everything from the circus to hulahooping to storytelling. The performing arts tent
    [link to performing arts page] is one that you just don’t want to miss with an extra special
    production from LAStheatre featuring our very own local artistes. You can’t miss the main music
    stage [link to main music page] but you wouldn’t want to anyway with music from south London acts to
    blow you away. There’s tons more to discover in the park so check it all out here!</p>

<p>But it’s not just about Westow Park on Saturday – there’s also loads going on in our venues, shops and
    markets in the area known locally the Triangle – Westow St, Church Road, Westow Hill and Central Hill.
    The Transition Town peeps are holding their weekly food market [link to food market website www.crystalpalacefoodmarket.co.uk]

    drink, the Phoenix Centre hold their annual fayre – just some of the festival events that you will
