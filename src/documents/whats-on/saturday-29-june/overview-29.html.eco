                    <p>Saturday features the big park event in Westow Park with more festival shenanigans than ever before!
                        Our <a href="/whats-on/saturday-29-june/kids-zone">kids' zone</a> is situated up by the Church Road entrance to the park and
                        has everything from the circus to hulahooping to storytelling. The <a href="/whats-on/saturday-29-june/performing-arts">performing arts tent</a>
                        is one that you just don't want to miss with an extra special production from LAStheatre
                        featuring our very own local artistes. You can't miss the <a href="/whats-on/saturday-29-june/bands">main music stage</a>,
                        but you wouldn't want to anyway, with music from south London acts to
                        blow you away. There's tons more to discover in the park so <a href="/info/programme">check it all out here</a>!</p>

                    <p>But it's not just about Westow Park on Saturday – there's also loads going on in our venues, shops and
