                    <p>Step inside and enter a Victorian wonderland of curiosities and oddities with theatrical,
                        inventive and mind-boggling interpretations of The Great Exhibition and beyond! Let your
                        hair down, loosen your corset and twiddle that moustache whilst poets, bands and theatremakers take to the main stage.</p>

                    <p>Or perhaps take an afternoon perambulation around our Cabinet of Curiosities to meet
                        inspiring minds and take part in workshops that inform and amaze. With a mixture of
                        local talent and theatrical beaux from further afield the <a href="http://www.lastheatre.com/">LAStheatre</a>
                        team and festival producers create an event which celebrates the inquiring mind of the
                        Victorian and the golden age of the Crystal Palace!</p>
