<p>Now Saturday’s a big day, but you won’t want to stay indoors on Sunday 30 June as the festival fun continues all
    around the Triangle, and at other venues such as <a href="/whats-on/sunday-30-june/soundtracks">Crystal Palace station</a> and
    the <a href="/whats-on/venues-around-town">Gipsy Hill Tavern</a>.</p>

<p>Kicking off with <a href="/whats-on/sunday-30-june/soundtracks">Soundtracks</a> our very own classical and resonant
    music concert at Crystal Palace station, wending its way throughout the Triangle and down Gipsy Hill with
    events at traders and restaurants such as Papa Gaio, Mediterrenea, The Bookseller Crow, Acorn our lead
    sponsors and Bambinos, the festival fun comes to our shops and stations. If you fancy being sporty, and you are
    not too hungover from Saturday, check out the fitness fun event at Victory Place (both Saturday and Sunday).
